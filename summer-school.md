## The Summer School in Computer Vision

The 28th BMVA Computer Vision Summer School (CVSS 2024) will take place between 7th - 11th July 2025 at [University of Aberdeen](https://www.abdn.ac.uk/). 

The event will consist of an intensive week of lectures and lab sessions covering a wide range of topics in Computer Vision. Lecturers are researchers in the field from some of the most active research groups in the UK and abroad. The summer school also fulfills an important social function in that it gives attendees a chance to meet other vision students and researchers from around the UK and beyond. 

Please see the [Computer Vision Summer School 2025 Website](https://cvss.bmva.org/) for more details.
If you have any queries while we are updating the website, please reach out to us at bmva-cvss2025@abdn.ac.uk.

### Call for Proposals to Host the 2024 Summer School!

The summer school is an excellent opportunity for computer vision researchers at the start of their careers and is a priority for the BMVA. This is only possible through the kind work of volunteers from the academic and industry communities who host and support the organisation of the school.

<h2>Volunteers for BMVA Summer School 2024: Deadline 24th July 2023</h2>

<p>We are asking for volunteers to host the BMVA Summer School (in 2024 and beyond)! The deadline for applications for 2024 is <b>24th July 2023</b>. Please submit an expression of interest via <a href="https://forms.gle/rY79xfc9xc38GdYz7">this google form</a>. At this stage, it is sufficient to express an interest in either hosting the summer school (in which case a proposed venue and dates are required) or to express interest in being involved in the organisation team for the school (which would be hosted elsewhere).
