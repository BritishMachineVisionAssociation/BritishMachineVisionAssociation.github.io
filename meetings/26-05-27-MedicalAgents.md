## Call for Presentations

The British Machine Vision Association (BMVA) is pleased to announce a one-day Technical Meeting entitled **Advancing Medical Care with AI Agents.** This symposium brings together researchers, clinicians, and industry practitioners to explore how artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision are transforming medical care, with a particular focus on oncology and surgery as clinically rich, challenging, and emerging application domains.

Early deep learning methods were primarily developed for perceptual tasks, and their capacity to support clinical decision workflows remains limited: they often cannot reliably articulate clinical logic, incorporate broader patient context, or explicitly coordinate temporal and multimodal signals. Today, the landscape has broadened with the rise of **agentic LLM systems** that can orchestrate multiple specialist models and tools over medical images, integrate multimodal clinical context, generate and refine explanations, critique intermediate results, and enable interactive, clinician-in-the-loop decision support. In this setting, LLMs provide a complementary paradigm that couples strong perception with **tool-mediated grounding, structured orchestration, and dialogue-based explanation.** Rather than replacing established imaging models, they can augment them by connecting outputs across tools, surfacing clinically relevant context, and supporting interactive, transparent workflows.

Such recent advances in AI agents, systems capable of perception, reasoning, and decision support within complex clinical environments, are enabling the integration of multimodal data and supporting medical workflows at scale. While cancer care and surgery serve as the central motivating use cases, the methods and insights discussed are expected to generalise across a broad range of disease areas, including cancer, neurological, cardiovascular, and chronic conditions.
The symposium will feature state-of-the-art research, real-world clinical deployments, and translational perspectives from academia, industry, and Barts Health NHS Trust hospitals. Submissions addressing both methodological advances and applied clinical impact are encouraged.

**Topics of Interest include (but are not limited to):**
* AI and computer vision for medical imaging (radiology, pathology, and computational imaging)

* Deep learning methods for detection, segmentation, and classification in healthcare

* AI agents for clinical decision support and workflow integration

* Multimodal learning integrating imaging, clinical records, genomics, and biomedical data

* Personalised and precision medicine, including treatment response prediction

* AI-driven treatment planning and therapy optimisation

* Artificial intelligence for drug discovery and translational medicine

* Agent-based approaches for virtual screening and clinical trial optimisation

* Responsible AI in healthcare: ethics, fairness, explainability, and robustness

* Regulatory, validation, and deployment challenges in clinical settings
* Real-world case studies of AI systems in cancer care and other disease domains

The meeting aims to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration, supporting the responsible translation of AI technologies into routine clinical practice.
Presentation Formats:
* Talks
* Posters
* Demos



**Important:** This is an in-person event, with no virtual attendance option. We kindly ask all
presenters to join us at the British Computer Society on the day.

**Presentations can be either published work, or ongoing research**. 

**The deadline for submitting a presentation is the 18th March 2026**
