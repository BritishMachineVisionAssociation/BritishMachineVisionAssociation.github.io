## Call for Presentations

The British Machine Vision Association (BMVA) is pleased to announce its upcoming one-day symposium on Sign Language Translation, Production, and Linguistics. This event aims to bring together researchers, academics, and industry professionals from the fields of computer vision, linguistics, and Deaf studies to explore the significant advancements and pressing challenges in automatic sign language processing.
This symposium will provide a platform for the dissemination of cutting-edge research and will foster collaboration between technical experts and the Deaf community. The day will feature a series of invited talks from leading figures in the field, alongside paper presentations, posters, and demos.
For the call, we invite you to express interest in presenting your ongoing or recently published research. We particularly encourage submissions from Deaf and Hard of Hearing researchers, and from teams that include members of the Deaf community. The symposium will be conducted in English and British Sign Language (BSL). We can also support additional Sign Languages on request, please contact us for further details. 

## Topics of Interest
We welcome submissions on a wide range of topics related to Sign Language, including, but not limited to:
* Sign Language Translation:
- Sign-to-text translation systems
- Data-driven and rule-based translation approaches
- Corpus development and alignment for translation
- Evaluation metrics for sign language translation
* Sign Language Production:
- Text/speech-to-sign synthesis
- Avatar-based and photorealistic sign language generation
- Modeling of co-articulation, prosody, and non-manual features
- Real-time sign language production systems
* Sign Language Linguistics:
- Computational models of sign language grammar and phonology
- The role of linguistics in sign language technology
- Annotation standards and methodologies for linguistic features
- Cross-linguistic studies of sign languages
* Computer Vision for Sign Language:
- Sign recognition and tracking (manual and non-manual features)
- Pose estimation and 3D reconstruction of signers
- Datasets and benchmarks for sign language research
- Machine learning techniques for sign language analysis
* Deaf Community Engagement and Impact:
- User-centric design of sign language technologies
- Ethical considerations in sign language research
- The role of Deaf researchers in the development process
- Applications of technology for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community

Important: This is an in-person event, with no virtual attendance option. We kindly ask all presenters to join us at the British Computer Society on the day.

**Presentations can be either published work, or ongoing research**.
