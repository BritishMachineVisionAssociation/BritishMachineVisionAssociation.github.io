## Call for Presentations

We are thrilled to invite researchers, engineers, and practitioners from academia and industry to a one-day symposium dedicated to the fast-evolving field of AI Security. This event will delve into the critical challenges and latest advancements in ensuring the safety, robustness, and trustworthiness of AI systems. We encourage submissions of your work—ranging from early-stage research and ongoing projects to previously published results—that align with the symposium’s theme.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
* Fairness, bias, and ethical considerations in large-scale AI models
* Hallucination and interpretability challenges in generative and predictive systems
* Robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks
* Certification and verification methods for AI systems
* Security and privacy implications of large-scale models
* Trustworthy AI in classical supervised machine learning
* Weakly supervised learning approaches, including self-supervised, semi-supervised, and noisy supervision techniques
* Adversarial examples and defenses in deep learning
* Explainability and accountability in AI decision-making
* Secure deployment of models in real-world applications
* Statistical and theoretical underpinnings of AI robustness

Not sure if your topic fits? Please contact the chairs for guidance.

Presentation formats include posters, demos, and talks. Please note that all oral
presentations require an accompanying poster or demo. Demos will be displayed alongside
posters during the day and can take the form of interactive experiences or visualisations. You can submit
your presentation proposal using the form below.

Important: This is an in-person event, with no virtual attendance option. We kindly ask all
presenters to join us at the British Computer Society on the day.

**Presentations can be either published work, or ongoing research**. 

**The deadline for submitting a presentation is the 14th May**
