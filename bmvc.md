### Call for Volunteers for hosting and organsing BMVC!

We are seeking volunteers to host and form the organising team for BMVC.

BMVC is a flagship conference and important conference for the global computer vision community; as such it is a priorty for the BMVA. The conference can only run with support of the vision community; the organisational teams include junior and senior researchers across both academia and industry from the UK and around the world. 

The vision community, and the size of the conference, has expanded over recent years and we currently plan for around 500 attendees. This places a strain on the old model of hosting within a university with a team entirely from the same university. Instead, BMVC has moved to a model where the conference is split with general chairs comprising a local chair and a programme chair. The local chair is responsible for overseeing the physical hosting of the conference and the programme chair for the selection of the papers (appointing area chairs and reviewers, etc...). These chairs lead teams of volunteers who do not need to be at the same institution and we encourage forming a diverse team from across the global vision community. 

The BMVA committee can assist with finding and securing venues if this is required (the scale of BMVC can now make it difficult to host within a university lecture theatre for example) and we can provide assistance with putting together the budget and sponsorship.

<h2>Volunteers for BMVC 2024: Deadline 24th July 2023</h2>

<p>For the expression of interest, we are looking for individuals with experience of organising or hosting workshops or conferences who would form the general local and/or programme chairs.</p>

<p>We are also looking for volunteers to form the programme committee (should have experience as an area chair or above) and the other roles of the organising committee (please see this year's conference website for examples of the roles required).</p>

<h2>BMVC Announcement : Risk of no conference for 2022</h2>

<p>
    Whilst the BMVA Executive Committee would like to thank those volunteers who have stepped forward to contribute to the organisation of BMVC 2022, <b>unfortunately, we are sorry to announce that we are still lacking sufficient experienced volunteers to serve as conference and programme chairs.</b>
</p>
<p>
    BMVC has grown substantially in size over the last few years and requires a larger team to run than previous conferences; we regret that, without sufficient academic and industrial researchers (both UK and international) helping to organise, we will be unable to provide a high quality conference.
</p>
<p>
    Please see below for more details on the call for volunteers. The <b>deadline for additional volunteers to put their names forward is 11:00 BST, 8th June 2022</b> and the Executive Committee will make a final announcement on whether or not to go ahead with the conference on 8th June.

<h2>BMVC Announcement : Conference will go ahead in 2022</h2>

<p>
    The BMVA Executive Committee are glad to announce that, due to many kind volunteers for the community, we now have sufficient numbers to go ahead with the conference for this year. The conference committee will now finalise the timeline and make an annoucement as soon as possible; <b>the expected submission deadline will be mid-July (after the annoucements from ECCV 2022 on 3rd July).</b>
</p>
<p>
    We will like to thank all those who got in contact with kind offers to help with a range of positions. We will be sending announcements out separately for those who kindly volunteered as reviewers or area chairs.
</p>
<p>
    We will shortly be announcing the bidding process for forming teams to host future BMVCs (2023 and onwards) as we try to get back to a normal cycle and we hope it will be OK to put some of our volunteers in contact with these teams for future conferences. 
</p>
<p>
    There are also additional BMVA positions that we are looking for volunteers for and details of these roles will be forwarded on; once again, we hope that kind volunteers from the community will consider taking these positions on.

<h2 id="open-letter-to-the-community-for-volunteers-for-bmvc-2022">Open Letter to the Community for Volunteers for BMVC 2022</h2>

<div style="text-align: left;">

<p>Dear BMVC Community,</p>

<p>During the turbulent pandemic times, I took on the mantle of the BMVC General Chair for the last two years to ensure that BMVC continued to happen in some form; like many other conferences, we ended up virtual and now have a tried and tested virtual conference model. BMVC continues to grow and flourish, it is something which we should all feel pride over, and I am exceptionally thankful for the hard work and support from the volunteers who made that happen.</p>

<p>The BMVA Executive Committee is arranging to run BMVC 2022 as a hybrid event. We are finalising dates with a physical venue in London for November, allowing for a similar timeline to last year. Itâ€™s now time to hand over the reins back to the community.</p>

<p>This year we intend to host a hybrid conference (along a similar timeline as the <a href="https://www.bmvc2021-virtualconference.com/dates/">2021 conference</a> with the in-person meeting held in London (alongside virtual attendance); this will follow a model from other conferences in the area for example CVPR.</p>

<h4 id="how-can-you-get-involved">How can you get involved?</h4>

<p>We need a programme committee that can ensure the high standards of academic content, engage with industry and help BMVC 2022 be another successful conference. While BMVC was traditionally a UK academic conference, we welcome applications from those outside the UK, and industry based researchers, reflecting the standing and scope of what BMVC has become.</p>

<h4 id="what-experience-do-i-need">What experience do I need?</h4>

<p>It has been great to see many early career researchers getting in touch to volunteer to serve as reviewers and area chairs - we are very grateful for this. We will do our best to contact everyone who has volunteered and make sure that they are added to the appropriate lists.</p>

<p><b>This call is particularly for researchers with more experience to serve at the programme and general chair level.</b> As a rough indication, we would hope that programme chairs would have experience serving as area chairs at previous conferences (not necessarily BMVC). At the same time, general chairs would have experience serving as programme chairs or organisers of previous conferences or workshops in the area. We hope that ensuring this sort of experience in the organising committee will allow us to continue to maintain the high standards built over previous conferences and keep innovating to try to improve further and respond to the ideas of the community.</p>

<p>Whilst we already have some very kind volunteers for some of the positions, the scale of BMVC requires a whole team to make a successful conference, and we will be unable to host a conference of sufficient quality without additional volunteers.</p>

<h4 id="we-are-looking-to-fill-the-following-positions">We are looking to fill the following positions:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Conference Chairs</li>
  <li>Program Chairs</li>
  <li>Keynote Chair</li>
  <li>Workshop Chair</li>
  <li>Awards Chair</li>
  <li>Sponsorship Chair</li>
  <li>Marketing Chair</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in getting involved, please drop me a line at chair@bmva.org, including a brief description of any prior experience of conference or workshop organisation and what you think you could offer BMVC 2022.</p>

<p>I can confirm that organising an important conference such as BMVC (whilst often an interesting learning curve) is a rewarding experience; it is great to work with enthusiastic colleagues from across the community and help support and disseminate the exciting international research being performed in our field. I also hope that such a contribution to the research community is valued at your host institution, be it academic or an industrial lab, and I would certainly be happy to provide letters to that affect to all who kindly volunteer their time. Please do get in touch.</p>

<p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>Neill</p>

<p>BMVA Chair</p>

<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
  <tbody>
    <tr><th scope="row">Is BMVC 2020 still on?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Yes. BMVC is in mid September and we can expect a lot of news between now and then.</td></tr>

    <tr><th scope="row">Will the paper submission deadline or other main conference deadlines be extended because of COVID-19?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>We have no plan to extend the deadline.</td></tr>

    <tr><th scope="row">Will all authors on a paper need to make themselves available as reviewers?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Our expectation is that the majority of authors should make themselves available as reviewers. At the time of abstract submission on CMT (a week before the paper deadline) the author list should be entered on CMT and an option will be available for authors to indicate which authors will be able to review - requests for certain authors to not be considered as reviewers can also be entered with a suitable justification. For example, junior researchers (e.g. early PhD and below) or authors who are not computer vision researchers (e.g. providing domain expertise for experiments) would be considered reasonable justification.</td></tr>

    <tr><th scope="row">How will presentations be handled for authors that cannot get a travel visa or for which there is a COVID-19 travel ban?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>No author will be disadvantaged due to restrictions on travel. Accepted papers will still be published subject to authors satisfying registration and presentation requirements. We are investigating options, e.g. remote presentations, and will provide more information in the coming months.</td></tr>

### Call for Papers

The British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC) is one of the major international conferences on computer vision and related areas. It is organised by the British Machine Vision Association (BMVA). The 31st BMVC will be held in Manchester, 7thâ€”11th Sept 2020.

Authors are invited to submit full-length high-quality papers in image processing, machine vision, and related areas for 2020 British Machine Vision Conference. Submitted papers will be refereed on their originality, presentation, empirical results, and quality of evaluation.

All papers will be reviewed doubly blind, normally by three members of our international programme committee. Please note that BMVC is a single track meeting with oral and poster presentations and will include three keynote presentations and two tutorials.

**Please Note**: In keeping with conferences in the field (e.g. [NeurIPS](https://medium.com/@NeurIPSConf/getting-started-with-neurips-2020-e350f9b39c28)) and to cope with the increasing number of submissions, we ask that all authors be prepared to review papers and make use of a compulsory abstract submission deadline a week before the paper submission deadline. The CMT submission site will ask authors to acknowledge this commitment and failure to engage with the reviewing process might be grounds for rejection.

Topics include, but are not limited to:

-  Statistics and machine learning for vision
-  Stereo, calibration, geometric modelling and processing
-  Face and gesture recognition
-  Early and biologically inspired vision
-  Motion, flow and tracking
-  Segmentation and grouping
-  Model-based vision
-  Image processing techniques and methods
-  Texture, shape and colour
-  Video analysis
-  Document processing and recognition
-  Vision for quality assurance, medical diagnosis, etc.
-  Vision for visualisation, interaction, and graphics
-  Object detection and recognition
-  Shape-from-X
-  Video analysis for action and event recognition
