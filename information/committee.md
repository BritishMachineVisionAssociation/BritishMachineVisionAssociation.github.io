## The Executive Committee

The _Executive Committee_ (ExCo) of the BMVA is the group of people charged
with running its affairs.  The ExCo consists of ten elected members, from whom
the principal officers of the Association are drawn, and several co-opted
members.  The duration of ExCo membership is normally two years, with half the
elected membership standing down each year.  (These people may, of course,
stand for re-election.)  Co-opted members have a tenure of one year.

The current ExCo is as follows:
